This is a classic Brick-Breaker game developed using Arduino and simulated on Wokwi.
The game features a paddle and a ball that players control to break bricks on the screen.
The objective is to destroy all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the screen. It involves basic game mechanics like paddle movement, ball bouncing, and collision detection with bricks.

Features:
1.Paddle controlled by user input.
2.Ball bouncing with realistic physics.
3.Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
4.Real-time simulation of game mechanics using Arduino and Wokwi.

Technologies Used:
1.Arduino for game logic and control.
2.Wokwi for simulating the Arduino hardware.
3.Basic electronics (e.g., sensors, LEDs, etc.) for game feedback.

How to Play:
1.Use the controls to move the paddle left and right.
2.Bounce the ball to hit and break the bricks.
3.Clear all the bricks to move to the next level.
4.Avoid letting the ball fall off the screen.
